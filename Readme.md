# Dockerized FastAPI Sepsis Prediction App with Machine-learning model ü©∫üê≥

## Description üöÄüìä

Welcome to the Sepsis Prediction FastAPI application!

This application allows you to predict sepsis in patients using a machine-learning model.

Deployed with Docker, this app makes it easy to make accurate predictions on patient data.

## Introduction

 Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to an infection.

 Early detection and intervention are critical to saving lives.

 In this project, we'll develop a FastAPI web application that predicts whether a patient has sepsis based on various medical attributes.

### Installation and Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

#### Getting Started

To run this application, follow these steps:

- Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

- Navigate to the Directory: Open a terminal and navigate to the cloned repository directory.

- Install Docker: Ensure that you have Docker installed on your machine.

- Build the Docker Image
- Run the dockeer image using the following command:

*docker build -t sepsis-prediction-app .*

Run the Docker Container: Once the image is built, run the Docker container using the following command:
*docker run -p 8000:8000 sepsis-prediction-app*
